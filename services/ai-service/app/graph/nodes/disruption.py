"""Disruption node: analyze a disruption against the current itinerary.

Runs before the planner when an existing trip is disrupted. It produces a short
analysis of what is affected; the planner then rebuilds the affected parts of the
timeline.

NOTE on graph ordering: the alerts node runs AFTER retrieve (in the plan/modify
path), so for the disruption path (intent → disruption → retrieve → ...) live
alerts are not yet in state when this node executes. We fetch them inline so the
disruption analysis always reflects real-world conditions.
