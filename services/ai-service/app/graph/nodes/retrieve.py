"""Retrieval node: pull semantic context from the multi-collection knowledge base.

This is the advanced RAG step. Based on the conversation intent we fan a single
embedded query out across the relevant Qdrant collections (hotels, activities,
transport, dining, culture, events), optionally filtering by destination city,
then flatten the source-tagged hits into ``state['retrieved']`` for the planner.

Also fetches Neo4j Place nodes for the destination so the planner can prefer
locations that have verified transport routes in the graph.
